        the Swiss Re Building (colloquially referred to as the Gherkin), is a skyscraper
        in London's main financial district, the City of London, completed in December 2003
        and opened at the end of May 2004. With 40 floors, the tower is 180 metres (591
        ft) tall, and stands on the former site of the Baltic Exchange building, which was
        severely damaged on 10 April 1992 by the explosion of a bomb placed by the Provisional
        IRA.

        The building is on the former site of the Baltic Exchange building, the headquarters
        of a global marketplace for ship sales and shipping information. On 10 April 1992
        the Provisional IRA detonated a bomb close to the Exchange, severely damaging the
        historic Exchange building and neighbouring structures. The UK government's statutory
        adviser on the historic environment, English Heritage, and the City of London governing
        body, the City of London Corporation, were keen that any redevelopment must restore
        the building's old façade onto St Mary Axe. The Exchange Hall was a celebrated fixture
        of the ship trading company.
