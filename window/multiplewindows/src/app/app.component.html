      <div>RISC</div>
      <div>
        Some aspects attributed to the first RISC-labeled designs around 1975 include the
        observations that the memory-restricted compilers of the time were often unable
        to take advantage of features intended to facilitate manual assembly coding, and
        that complex addressing modes take many cycles to perform due to the required additional
        memory accesses...

      <div>CISC</div>
      <div>
        Before the RISC philosophy became prominent, many computer architects tried to bridge
        the so called semantic gap, i.e. to design instruction sets that directly supported
        high-level programming constructs such as procedure calls, loop control, and complex
        addressing modes, allowing data structure and array accesses to be combined into
        single instructions. Instructions are also typically highly encoded in order to
        further enhance the code density...

      <div>
        A database management system (DBMS) is a software package with computer programs
        that control the creation, maintenance, and the use of a database. It allows organizations
        to conveniently develop databases for various applications by database administrators
        (DBAs) and other specialists. A database is an integrated collection of data records,
        files, and other database objects...
