      <strong>Leo</strong> the Lion is one of the earliest recognized constellations.
      The Mesopotamians are known to have documented the 'lion' constellation. The Persians
      called it Ser or Shir; the Turks, Artan; the Syrians, Aryo; the Jewish, Arye; the
      Indians, Simha. These are all translated as 'lion.'
